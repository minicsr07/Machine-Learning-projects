Built a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham** using text-based features.

**Approach**
- Performed text preprocessing and cleaning
- Converted text data into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** classifier
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification metrics

**Technologies Used**
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  

**Results**
- Achieved ~95% accuracy on the SMS spam dataset
